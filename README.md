# Student Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores a synthetic dataset of student performance (200 rows X 9 columns) using Pytho & Ecel.
The goal was to practice a real-world data science workflow: data cleaning, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and group comparisons.

# Steps Performed
-
 Checked dataset shape, column data types, and missing values  
-
 Generated summary statistics (mean, std, min, max, quartiles)  
-
 Explored variable distributions (histograms and descriptive stats)  
-
 Converted categorical variables into numerical form to enable correlation analysis  
-
 Computed correlation matrix to identify relationships with final grades (G3)  
-
 Compared performance by gender and by school

# Key Findings 

-
No Missing Data
- dataset was clean from the start
-

Final Grades (G3)
average around ~9.5 (0-19 range)
